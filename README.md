Jamming is a website created using REACT.

This projects allows users to search for music using the Spotify API and create a personal playlist from the site and uploads directly to there account. 

The features allow users to search for music, add and delete tracks to the playlist and change the name of the new playlist as well. 

This was one of the longest projects that I have created and was an excellent challenge. I learned alot about componenets creating this app.
